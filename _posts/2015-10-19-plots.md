Today I finally got some plots out of root! From real data! That's _awesome_! I mean technically the data is simulated but the method is sound(ish). The problem I've been having is that the documentation which exists for ROOT/art/LArSoft/uboonecode is either too much to properly read, too little to be of any use, or is the perfect amount but not particularly accessible. Somehow, by cobbling together bits from here and there (and with a bit of advice from people in the department), I've managed to get it working.
 <br> <br>
 
Everything is awesome!
<br> <br>

The general idea, is to get some art-ROOT data file from the MicroBooNE servers, and then to run
<br> <br>
```
lar -c anatree.fcl artrootfile.root
```
<br> <br>
which outputs a root file of reconstructed data `standard_reco_hist.root`. From ROOT, a .C and .h can then be automatically generated:
<br> <br>
```
TFile *f = new TFile("standard_reco_hist.root");

TDirectoryFile *l = f->Get("analysistree");

l->cd();

anatree->MakeClass(newName);
```
<br> <br>
you can then add logic to `newName.C` to print out histograms from the data 'leaves' in the TTree file. and run the macro by typing the following in the ROOT interpreter:
<br> <br>
```
.L newName.C;

newName t

t.Loop()
```
<br> <br>
and hey presto! Histograms!


I'm definitely beginning to understand why people don't get on with ROOT.
