Well, I'm still in the process of getting this blog to work with Jekyll, but
hopefully when I commit this it'll be alright and everything will go to plan. So,
here we are, with the least original first blog post title in the world.

I'm going to keep this one short because I reall want to see if this works.

Catch you on the flip side.
God, that's so nineties.
