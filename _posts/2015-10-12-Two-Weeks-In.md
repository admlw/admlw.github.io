So I've survived (roughly) two weeks! 3 years 50 weeks to go. Crazy! This is my second time trying to write this --- the first one was needlessly negative. The first two-ish weeks have been really good! Getting used to academia again has been a massive change of pace from retail, but it's a change for the better, and once I get back in to the rhythm of things I'm sure it'll begin to click.



The thing that I was almost negative about is that everyone is so ridiculously clever, and they all seem to be experts in everything, meaning that I feel like a bit of a dunce. It's understandable though, they've been at it longer than I have and I've been out of it for over a year. I'm more than a little rusty.



Anyway, on to the stuff I've actually been *doing*. I guess the big thing here is that I found out which experiment I'm going to be working on for the duration of the PhD and it's (drumroll please...) [MicroBooNE](http://www-microboone.fnal.gov/)! It probably means nothing to anybody outside of the field, but it's really awesome, and perfectly timed seeing as it's starting to take data this week and is running for 3 years! There's a chance to do some really interesting work and the collaboration, which is based at Fermilab in Chicago, is really decently sized. I'm really happy about it! The excitement was short lived, however, due to the fact I've basically had my head buried under documentation for C++, ROOT, and art since I found out. They're pretty dense, but once I can use them I can move on to doing some interesting stuff and analysis... well, that might not be until next year but it doesn't hurt to be forward looking does it?



Apart from documentation, a lot of my time has been taken up by meetings. Jesus Christ, I did not anticipate this number of meetings, and the number only seems to go up as you climb the career rungs. I don't know where my supervisor finds time to actually do research! 



Anyway, I'm not really sure what's good for length for one of these posts so I think I'll leave it here. Hopefully there'll be more interesting stuff to post about in the next couple of weeks!
