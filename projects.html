				<p>Abstract: Neutrino oscillations are now well documented with an impressive amount of literature on the topic. Oscillation experiments have an important place at the forefront of high energy physics, with opportunities for both precision studies of the Standard Model and to discover new physics, allowing us to further explore our understanding of the universe. This dissertation provides the mathematical framework of neutrino oscillations, both in vacuumandinmatter, fortheunphysical 2ν caseandtherealistic 3ν case. Precisionstudies of the future Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment are carried out using the GLoBES simulation software, with particular attention paid to resolving the three big questions in oscillation physics: what is the true mass hierarchy? Is CP violated in the leptonic sector? What is the octant of the θ23 mixing angle? These simulations demonstrate the ability of LBNE to break the eight-fold degeneracy that plagues neutrino oscillation physics, and therefore constrain the parameters associated with oscillations.</p>
