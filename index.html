title: Adam Lister's Webpage
---


				<p>Hi, I'm <b>Adam</b> and pretty soon I'm going to beginning a <b>PhD in
				experimental particle physics</b> at <b>Lancaster university</b>, where my main
				topic of research will be neutrinos. This website is hopefully going to 
				function as a portfolio for any projects I undertake over the course 
				of the next three years. I'm also planning to keep track of my progress by
				keeping a blog.
				<br><br>
				I recieved my <b>BSc Astrophysics</b> from Aberystwyth University in 2013, and
				and my <b>MSc Particles, Strings and Cosmoology</b> from Durham University the
				following year.
				<br><br>
				The site's not fully set up yet, but in the meantime feel free to follow me on 
				<b><a href="https://twitter.com/adamlister92" class="twitlink">Twitter</a></b>,
