				<p>Hi, I'm <b>Adam</b> and I'm a first year <b>PhD student in
				experimental particle physics</b> at <b>Lancaster University</b>, where my main
				topic of research is neutrinos, specifically working as part the <b><a href="http://www-microboone.fnal.gov/">MicroBooNE collaboration</a></a></b>. This website is hopefully going to 
				function as a portfolio for any projects I undertake over the course 
				of the next three years. I'm also planning to keep track of my progress by
				keeping a blog.
				<br><br>
				I recieved my <b>BSc Astrophysics</b> from Aberystwyth University in 2013, and
				and my <b>MSc Particles, Strings and Cosmology</b> from Durham University the
				following year.
				<br><br>
